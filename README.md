## Getting Started

1. Download the Latest release in Releases (File ending in **.RBXMX**)
2. Drag the file into your Roblox Studio Workspace or Viewport.
3. Move the **"abau"** folder to ServerScriptService. Preferably in a folder named **"Server"** for organization.
4. Config the system by going to: **"abau" -> "server" -> "config"**

Types will exported from these modules so you use them to get that sweet auto-completion if you plan on modifying.

Other than that, **"it should just work"**, and that's it!
